# 📄 Product Requirements Document (PRD): StoryOS

**Version:** 1.2 (Narrative OS)  
**Status:** Alpha  
**Vision:** A narrative operating system for collaborative storytelling.

---

## 1. Executive Summary
**StoryOS** is a lightweight creative front-end for collaborative, non-linear storytelling. It helps creators structure “Idea States,” build branching narrative scenes using D&D-style play, and collect dialogue packs as assets—designed to later connect to Story Protocol for IP registration and licensing.

## 2. Core Value Proposition
1.  **Idea States:** A structured format to define the initial conditions, lore, and logic of a narrative world before writing begins.
2.  **Collaborative Branching:** Run "scenes" like D&D sessions where AI or human collaborators drive branching outcomes.
3.  **Asset Collection:** Automatically turn successful scenes and dialogues into reusable IP assets for Story Protocol.

---

## 3. User Personas
*   **The World Builder:** Wants to define the "physics" and "rules" of their story world (The Idea State).
*   **The Narrative Designer:** Wants to simulate how characters interact within that world to generate plot points.
*   **The IP Creator:** Wants to register their characters and dialogue packs as licensable assets.

## 4. Feature Scope

### Phase 1: The Creative Shell (Current Alpha)
*   **Spatial UI:** Draggable icons, glass-morphism windows.
*   **Writer's Room:** Simple text editor for defining Idea States.
*   **Gemini Live Agent:** "Muze" — acts as a co-writer or GM to simulate branching scenes.
*   **IP Launcher:** Registering text/images as IP Assets on Story Protocol (Odyssey Testnet).

### Phase 2: Collaborative Simulation
*   **Multiplayer Scenes:** Invite others to join a scene (like a chat room or VTT).
*   **Branching Tree:** Visual graph showing how a story diverged based on user choices.
*   **Dialogue Packer:** Export chat logs as structured dialogue datasets.

### Phase 3: The Protocol Layer
*   **IP Registration:** One-click minting of "Idea States" and "Dialogue Packs".
*   **Licensing:** Allow other writers to fork your Idea State to create their own branches.

## 5. Design System & Aesthetics
*   **Philosophy:** "Diegetic UI". The interface should feel like a device *inside* the creative process.
*   **Inspirations:**
    *   *Macintosh System 7* (The structure)
    *   *Cyberpunk 2077* (The motion & glitch effects)
    *   *HyperCard* (The non-linear linking)
