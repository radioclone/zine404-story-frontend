## ⚡ The Origin Story

**StoryOS** is the evolution of a 2-year journey by a **studio musician and new media artist** learning to build software.

The seed was planted during a workshop with UX pioneer **Jaime Levy** (creator of *Word* and early interactive media). What began as a side project exploring HyperCard aesthetics grew into a "science agentic lore" experiment titled **"Finding Nakamoto."**

For this Buildathon, we transformed that lore into a functional reality: a "Surreal Desktop" where the chaotic, non-linear nature of creativity is simulated, spoken to, and finally minted on-chain.

## 🔮 What is StoryOS?

StoryOS is a lightweight creative front-end for collaborative, non-linear storytelling. It treats the browser not as a page, but as a **Creative Operating System**.

1.  **Idea States:** Structure the initial conditions of your narrative world (Genre, Tone, Logic).
2.  **The Writer's Room:** A multiplayer simulation where AI agents and collaborators "drop in" to edit scripts in real-time.
3.  **Theatre of the Mind:** Using **Gemini Multimodal Live** and **ElevenLabs**, creators can "talk" to their story, rolling dice and acting out scenes in real-time.

## ⛓️ Story Protocol Integration

StoryOS acts as the **"Sovereignty Layer"** for the creative desktop.

*   **Asset Registration:** Every text file ("Idea State") and dialogue transcript can be registered as a Programmable IP Asset (PIL) on the **Odyssey Testnet**.
*   **Licensing:** Users can set commercial or social remix terms directly from the OS interface via the "IP Launcher" app.
*   **Remixing:** The OS is designed to load existing IP IDs to create derivative works (Remixes), tracking the lineage of the story.

## 🏗 System Architecture

The project is designed as a retro-futurist OS, built with a "Diegetic UI" philosophy.

### 1. The Spatial Layer (UI/UX)
*   **Engine:** React 19 + Tailwind CSS + Phaser (Background Visuals).
*   **Aesthetics:** High-fidelity pixel art, CRT scanlines, and glassmorphism.
*   **Inspiration:** Macintosh System 7, HyperCard, and Cyberpunk interfaces.

### 2. The Intelligence Layer (Hybrid AI)
*   **Narrative Engine:** **Google Gemini Multimodal Live API**. Acts as "Muze" — the Game Master that simulates the world and critiques plot points.
*   **Voice Interface:** **ElevenLabs Conversational AI**. Provides the high-fidelity personality for the OS and characters, handling the "human-like" interaction layer.
*   **Simulated Collaboration:** The OS simulates a chaotic writer's room with virtual users joining and typing in real-time.

### 3. The Audio Layer
*   **Engine:** `Tone.js`.
*   **Feature:** Procedural "Focus Mode" music (Bill Evans-style jazz chords) that reacts to UI interactions.
