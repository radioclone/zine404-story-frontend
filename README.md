# 🎬 StoryOS

> StoryOS is a lightweight creative front-end for collaborative, non-linear storytelling. It helps creators structure “Idea States,” build branching narrative scenes using D&D-style play, and collect dialogue packs as assets—designed to later connect to Story Protocol for IP registration and licensing.

## 🔮 The Vision

*   **Idea States:** Define the initial conditions of your narrative world.
*   **Branching Scenes:** Roleplay outcomes with AI or peers (D&D-style).
*   **Asset Collection:** Turn dialogues and lore into reusable IP assets.

## 🏗 System Architecture

The project is designed as a retro-futurist OS.

### 1. The Spatial Layer (UI/UX)
*   **Engine:** React 19 + Tailwind CSS.
*   **Aesthetics:** High-fidelity pixel art, CRT scanlines, and glassmorphism.
*   **Audio:** Procedural "Focus Mode" music using `Tone.js`.

### 2. The Intelligence Layer (AI Game Master)
*   **Provider:** Google Gemini Multimodal Live API.
*   **Persona:** "Muze" — currently a creative writing assistant.
*   **Real-Time:** Low-latency voice interaction for "Theatre of the Mind" gameplay.

### 3. The Sovereignty Layer (Web3)
*   **Protocol:** Story Protocol (Odyssey Testnet).
*   **Assets:** Every file (Image, Text, Audio) can be minted as a **Programmable IP Asset**.
