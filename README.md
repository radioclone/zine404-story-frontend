## ⚡ The Origin Story

**StoryOS** is the evolution of a 2-year journey by a **studio musician and new media artist** learning to build software.

The seed was planted during a workshop with UX pioneer **Jaime Levy** (creator of *Word* and early interactive media). What began as a side project exploring HyperCard aesthetics grew into a "science agentic lore" experiment titled **"Finding Nakamoto."**

For this Buildathon, we transformed that lore into a functional reality: a "Surreal Desktop" where the chaotic, non-linear nature of creativity is simulated, spoken to, and finally minted on-chain.

## 🔮 What is StoryOS?

StoryOS is a lightweight creative front-end for collaborative, non-linear storytelling. It treats the browser not as a page, but as a **Creative Operating System**.

1.  **The Creative Shell:** A spatial desktop interface with procedural audio and visual reactivity.
2.  **The Writer's Room:** A multiplayer simulation where AI agents ("Muze") and collaborators "drop in" to edit scripts in real-time using Voice and Text.
3.  **The Sovereignty Layer:** Connects directly to **Story Protocol** to register "Idea States" and dialogue packs as programmable IP assets.

## 🔗 Story Protocol Integration

StoryOS serves as a visual abstraction layer over **Story Protocol**, bridging the gap between raw creativity and on-chain sovereignty. We utilize the **Odyssey Testnet** to turn "Idea States" into Programmable IP Assets.

### How it Works
1.  **Minting & Registration:**
    We use the `@story-protocol/core-sdk` to mint the "Idea State" (text/metadata) as an NFT and register it as an IP Asset in a single transaction via `client.ipAsset.mintAndRegisterIp`. This ensures every creative draft has a unique on-chain identity.

2.  **Programmable Licensing:**
    The OS abstracts complex PIL (Programmable IP License) terms into two creator-friendly archetypes:
    *   **Social Remix:** Sets terms for non-commercial sharing, attribution, and share-alike logic.
    *   **Commercial Franchise:** Configures revenue sharing (e.g., 15%) and upfront minting fees, allowing downstream creators to automatically pay the original author via smart contracts.

3.  **The Odyssey Network:**
    All transactions currently settle on the Story Odyssey Testnet, ensuring fast and low-cost experimentation for builders.

## 🏗 Key Features

### 1. The Spatial Layer (UI/UX)
*   **Engine:** React 19 + Tailwind CSS + Phaser (Background Visuals).
*   **Aesthetics:** High-fidelity pixel art, CRT scanlines, and glassmorphism.
*   **Audio:** Procedural "Focus Mode" music (Bill Evans-style jazz chords) generated by `Tone.js`.

### 2. The Intelligence Layer (Hybrid AI)
*   **Narrative Engine:** **Google Gemini Multimodal Live API**. Acts as "Muze" — the Game Master that simulates the world and critiques plot points via low-latency voice.
*   **Legal Advisor:** **Gemini 2.5 Flash**. Analyzes creative drafts to suggest appropriate "Social Remix" or "Commercial Franchise" licensing terms.
*   **Simulated Collaboration:** The OS simulates a chaotic writer's room with virtual users joining and typing in real-time.

### 3. The Protocol Layer
*   **Registration:** One-click minting of text files and assets on the **Odyssey Testnet**.
*   **Licensing:** Users can select Programmable IP License (PIL) terms directly from the OS interface.
